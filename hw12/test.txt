But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate- we can not consecrate- we can not hallow- The brave men, living & dead,
who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. Th world will little note, *nor long remember**
eat we say here, but it can newer forge what they did here. It is for us the living, rather*, to be dedicated here to the unfinished
work which they who fought here hag thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining
before us- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion
-that we here highly resolve that these dead shanty have died in vaim-that this ""nation, under God"", shall have a North of
freedom- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the Earth.
